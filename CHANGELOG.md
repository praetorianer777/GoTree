and the versioning [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Heirlooms: record objects handed down in the family with what they are, when and where they were
  made and where they are now, a timeline of who held them and how they got them, photos and
  sources; each person page lists the heirlooms they held, and GEDCOM files carry them as
  documented _HEIRLOOM records that GoTree reads back (#36)

- Wall chart: ancestors, descendants or both as a print-ready chart on A4 to A0, Letter, Tabloid
  or a custom size, fitted to the page with a warning when names get too small, with photos and a
  title; print it or save it as PDF from the browser, or download a standalone SVG (#34)

- Source-first transcription: copy a census household, baptism, marriage, burial, death or any
  other record into a grid, or define your own record templates; each person is matched against
  the tree, also across spelling variants (Meyer, Maier, Mayr), and adding the record creates the
  new people, the event with everyone's role, the couple's or parents' family, occupations,
  residences and births estimated from ages, each cited to its line in the record and to the value
  it supports (#32)

- Research tasks and a research log: plan what to find out (status, priority, due date, linked
  people, sources and places) and record every search with where and when, including the ones that
  found nothing; a missing or unsourced birth, a missing death or any data-quality problem becomes
  a task with one click; open tasks show on the home page, and each person page lists their tasks,
  searches and suggestions (#30)

- Calendar of birthdays, wedding anniversaries and remembrance days to subscribe to in any
  calendar app, through a secret address that can be withdrawn; living people only when chosen
  (#25)

- Share links: the owner creates read-only links for relatives without an account, for the whole
  tree or one branch, leaving living people out or showing them by name only, optionally until a
  date; visitors browse people and the tree, and a link can be withdrawn at any time. “On this
  day” lists births, marriages and deaths of deceased relatives on today's date, on the home page
  and in the shared view (#24)

- Backup: administrators download the database (a consistent snapshot taken while GoTree runs)
  and all photos and documents as one zip, with restore instructions inside; light, dark or
  system theme, chosen in the header and remembered per browser (#23)

- Data quality: GoTree checks the tree for dates that contradict each other (born after death,
  parents too young or too old, events after a burial, marriages outside a lifetime) and for dates
  it cannot read, on a data quality page and on each person's page; vague dates only count when
  every reading of them is impossible. “Tidy up dates” rewrites dates such as “12.3.1850”,
  “ca. 1850” or “March 12, 1850” in standard GEDCOM form after a preview where each row can be
  left out. The relationship calculator names how two people are related (cousins with removals,
  half and step relations, in-laws, pedigree collapse) and shows the line connecting them (#21)

- GEDCOM export as 5.5.1 or 7.0, optionally zipped with all photos and documents, with everyone,
  living people by name only, or without living people; everything an import could not use is
  written back, and “Check the export” reads the file back to show that nothing was lost (#19)

- GEDCOM import (5.5, 5.5.1 and 7.0, also zipped) from Ancestry, MyHeritage, FamilySearch,
  webtrees, Gramps or RootsMagic, in UTF-8, UTF-16, ANSI or ANSEL; a report shows what was imported,
  kept unchanged for the export, or dropped, and lists dates and references that need attention
  (#17)

- Photos, documents and recordings: upload them to people (stored once even when uploaded twice),
  view, describe and transcribe them, tag faces by drawing a box or import the face tags other
  photo tools wrote, and use a photo or a face as a person's portrait, shown in lists and on the
  tree (#15)

### Fixed

- A data directory whose path contains `#` or `?` no longer opens the wrong database file (#19)

### Changed

- A new version of GoTree no longer reloads open pages by itself; a notice offers to reload, so
  nothing being typed or uploaded is lost (#15)

- Sources and archives: record where facts come from, cite a source with page and reliability
  on events, people and relationships, and see on each source what it supports (#13)

- Family tree charts: ancestors (pedigree), descendants, both (hourglass) and the family group,
  with pan and zoom, a generations slider and a "blood relatives only" filter; select a person to
  center the tree on them, open their page or add relatives (#11)
- Arrow keys move between related people in the chart, and every chart is also available as a
  list for screen readers and small screens (#11)

- People list with search, and a person page with life events in date order, parents and
  siblings, partners and children (#9)
- Add parents, partners, children and siblings in any order, as new or existing people; adding
  a married partner creates the marriage event (#9)
- Dialogs to edit people, events (with a live date preview, place search and creation, shared
  participants and fact status) and families; keyboard shortcuts, `?` lists them (#9)

- People with alternate names, families with unknown partners and per-parent child relations,
  events with GEDCOM dates, shared events with roles, a place hierarchy, and disputed or
  disproven facts; name search ignores accents and covers alternate names (#7)
- First-run setup, login and logout; every change is recorded in a change log (#7)

- Single-binary server with embedded web UI, SQLite storage with automatic migrations, a
  health endpoint and a Docker image; the responsive, accessible app shell installs as a
  web app (#5)

- Release script and workflow: `release.sh` cuts a tagged release from the commit history, and
  the release workflow publishes binaries and a Docker image for every tag (#1)
